# RestFul Standalone application that processes basic CRM operation.

- The application is based on Spring and most of its libraries by using Microservices Architecture concepts in order to create a lightweight enterprise service, highly scalable and available that runs independently from an external container but still provides enterprise ready features.

- The concern about code coverage is very relevant in that application. In order to guarantee 100% percent of code coverage, Jacoco has been configured during maven build. If the application doesn't have 100% of code coverage, the build will fail. After successful build, go on /target/site/index.html to see more details about project code coverage (Configuration classes were excluded from Jacoco's validation).

- In order to guarantee documentation of rest services, Swagger has been configured so that it gives us some documentation about the rest services and its methods, schemas, parameters, URL etc. After starting the application go on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html. You can also get response from the application through this UI (using differents methods, parameters, url, etc.)

- This systems utilizes MySQL Server as Database to garantee integrity on the data storage. Open the file: src/main/resources/application.properties and set your own configurations for the database connection.
